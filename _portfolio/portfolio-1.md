title: "Black Hole Superradiance"
excerpt: "The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration has offered groundbreaking insights into black holes (BHs), which are central to modern physics, serving as unique laboratories for studying the universe. A key aspect of rotating BHs is their interaction with ultralight bosons, such as axions, promising candidates for dark matter. Through the phenomenon of superradiance, axions can extract energy and angular momentum from black holes, forming dense clouds around them. This structure, akin to an electron in a hydrogen atom, is termed as “gravitational atom (GA)”. Superradiance phenomena can produce observable signatures in the electromagnetic or gravitational wave (GW) spectrum. It gives unique predictions in the binary black hole (BBH) coalescence, which can be possibly observed by the LVK collaboration. Furthermore, the spectrum of the “gravitational atom” opens a window to study spacetime dynamics near rotating black holes, furthering our understanding of general relativity under near-extreme conditions. <br/><img src='/images/SuperRad.png'>"

# Description

The main motivation for studying black hole (BH) superradiance is to explore how astrophysical objects with strong gravitational effects can be used to probe particles beyond the Standard Model (BSM), which interact only weakly with baryonic matter. A rotating BH can generate an ultralight boson cloud through purely gravitational interactions, forming a so-called "Gravitational Atom" (GA). This structure can produce observable imprints, such as gravitational wave (GW) signals, that carry information about the properties of these ultralight BSM particles.

When a GA has a binary companion, even more interesting phenomena can arise. For example, if the orbital frequency of the companion matches the energy difference between two GA eigenstates, a Landau-Zener resonance transition can occur. This induces transitions between eigenstates, allowing the GA to exchange energy and angular momentum. Such changes create a backreaction on the binary companion, altering its orbital motion—an effect that could be detectable through various observational channels. This provides an alternative method to confirm the existence of such BSM bosonic particles.

Furthermore, when the binary companion lies within the boson cloud, ionization (or dynamical friction) can be more efficient than GW emission in depleting the orbital energy. Additionally, the presence of the binary companion can influence the growth rate of the cloud itself. Please check my publications below for more details.
