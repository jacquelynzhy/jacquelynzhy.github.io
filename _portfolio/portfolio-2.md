title: "Induced Gravitational Wave"
excerpt: "Primordial fluctuations, such as scalar and tensor fluctuations, are of great importance in the current study of modern cosmology. 
Large density perturbations with short wavelengths can lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs)
which has aroused significant interest recently, as they can be considered as promising dark matter candidates.
Meanwhile, it can also induce long-wavelength GWs inside the horizon or tensor modes outside the
horizon, which can be possibly observed by the cosmic microwave background (CMB).
The observable of this GW is its energy density, which is proportional to its power spectrum. Previous
studies of its power spectrum have primarily focused on the secondary scalar-induced gravitational wave... <br/><img src='/images/GW.png'>"
