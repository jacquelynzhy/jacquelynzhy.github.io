# Piano 


Apart from physics, I am also a pianist with over 20 years of training. During my undergraduate years, I founded the Piano Association at SUSTech and served as its vice president. You can listen to me playing one of my favorite melodies from the classical music history [here](https://www.douban.com/doubanapp/dispatch?uri=%2Fstatus%2F3986204497%2F%3F_spm_id%3DMTE0NDk3NTQw&_i=488410099fdbc81&dt_dapp=1) (Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2, second movement).

Thanks to my perfect pitch, I also rearrange ACG music and upload it to [Bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/2215256?spm_id_from=333.337.0.0) — often referred to as the Chinese YouTube — where I have around 22,000 followers.



# Music

In addition to the piano, I served as the principal cellist in my university orchestra, although I have not continued playing the cello since graduation.

While I’m open to all kinds of music, I’m particularly drawn to classical genres—especially the Late Romantic period (such as Rachmaninoff and Tchaikovsky), Nationalist composers (like Dvořák and Borodin), and Impressionists (including Ravel and Debussy).

Beyond classical music, I also enjoy genres such as jazz, R&B, funk, and city pop.
