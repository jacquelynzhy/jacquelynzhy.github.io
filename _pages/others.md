# Piano 

Apart from physics, I am also a pianist with over 20 years of training. During my undergraduate years, I founded the Piano Association at SUSTech and served as its vice president. You can listen to me playing one of my favorite melodies from the classical music history [here](https://www.douban.com/doubanapp/dispatch?uri=%2Fstatus%2F3986204497%2F%3F_spm_id%3DMTE0NDk3NTQw&_i=488410099fdbc81&dt_dapp=1) (Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2, second movement).

Thanks to my perfect pitch, I also rearrange ACG music and upload it to [Bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/2215256?spm_id_from=333.337.0.0) — often referred to as the Chinese YouTube — where I have around 22,000 followers.



# Music

Besides the piano, I was also the principal cellist in my university orchestra, although I didn’t continue playing the cello after graduation.

I’m open to all kinds of music, but I’m especially drawn to classical music, particularly Late Romantic (like Rachmaninoff and Tchaikovsky), Nationalist composers (such as Dvořák and Borodin), and Impressionists (like Ravel and Debussy).

Outside of classical music, I find myself more into genres like Jazz, R&B, Funk, and City Pop.
