Hi! I'm Huiyu ZHU (朱慧宇), and you can also call me Jacquelyn.

I am a postdoctoral researcher in black hole physics and cosmology, currently working with the [CTPU-CGA group](https://ibs.re.kr/ctpu-cga/) at the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) in Daejeon, Korea. I received my PhD in October 2024 from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) [Institute For Advanced Study](https://ias.hkust.edu.hk/), under the supervision of Prof. [Yi Wang](https://phyw.people.ust.hk/) and Prof. George Smoot.

My research primarily focuses on black hole superradiance and gravitational waves induced by ultralight fields. You can find my publications on [INSPIRE](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1873038?ui-citation-summary=true).

Outside of physics, I’m a classically trained pianist with over twenty years of experience. I’m passionate about classical music, painting, film—essentially all forms of art. I also enjoy traveling and love exploring different cultures and perspectives around the world.

I was born in Shenzhen (深圳), one of the fastest-developing cities in southern China, right next to Hong Kong. I completed my undergraduate studies at SUSTech, working with Prof. Leonardo Modesto. After that, I moved to Hong Kong for five years of PhD studies, where I also enjoyed the sea views and great seafood.

I am now a postdoctoral researcher in Korea, where I experienced my first real winter with snow. Snow is lovely, but I do miss the sea.
